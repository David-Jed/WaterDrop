# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Main development:

### accomplishments:
Release covers:
Full server backend connection with frontend
Support for History (water usage)
Basic dashboard systems.
Email support (Since I don't own SMTP server, its rate limited to 2 signups per hour)
Login/signup and logout support.
basic statistics


Due to time limitations, some features were scrapped:
Frontend sync connection with ESP/Arduino board (Backend however supports this already.)
Notifications (I couldnt figure out for the life of me how to properly set them up :/)
Display brightness & dark mode.
Oauth with our providers (Gmail, Apple) - Use the email login system
visual graphs (scatterplot graph) for statistics.
Had signing issues for compiling app for native (android and IOS) -> For testing purposes install expo go and run development build locally.
